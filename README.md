Bittensor Subnet Research Project
Overview

This repository contains data and research on the subnets operating within the Bittensor ecosystem, a decentralized network designed to incentivize the development and sharing of artificial intelligence models. The research focuses on identifying key subnets, their teams, contributors, purposes, and their time on the Bittensor network.

Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

    /data: Raw datasets and subnet information.
    /documentation: Detailed descriptions of the subnets, methodologies, and sources.
    /scripts: Any scripts or code used to process the data.

Objectives

The project aims to:

    - Identify and document all active subnets on the Bittensor network.
    - Provide insights into the teams, contributors, and developers behind each subnet.
    - Offer a summary of each subnet's purpose, functionality, and contributions to the ecosystem.
    - Track time on the network for each subnet to understand longevity and activity.
    - Maintain a transparent and verifiable record by citing all sources used in the research.

Contribution

We welcome contributions from BitAgent team members! Feel free to reach out to collaborate.
